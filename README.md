who wants to be a millionaire

This game was designed in two parts. 

Initially it was a console game. The user inputs basic information to create a "profile".
These questions included name, location, age and a few general questions.
These questions were then saved to a SQL database. 

The console then outputs questions from a text file. 
If the answer is right, the user can progress and earn more money. 
There are checkpoints with money throughout the game. 

The second part of the game was a GUI for the game. 
The GUI is not fully complete yet. It works by offering four buttons. 
The question is displayed in a text box. 
If the user clicks the right button they may proceed.
